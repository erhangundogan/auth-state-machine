# Auth State Machine

Create-react-app instance with the minimal state machine to demonstrate auth process (login, register) and redirect to home page with router integration.

You can change [this line of code](https://github.com/erhangundogan/auth-state-machine/blob/master/src/machine/auth.js#L64) to `resolve()` OR `reject()` to simulate registered and anonymous user.

Please see the state machine rules [here](src/machine/auth.js)
